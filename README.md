<h2>AAP- An app that connects NGO and volunteers</h2>
<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3> 

Considering the socio-economic status of 138 crore population of our country, NGO’s in India have been rampantly working towards upliftment of social voids, generating awareness and acting as torch bearers lighting people’s lives.
All they need are volunteers and support from the privileged one’s and these volunteers act as a backbone of any Non-profit organizations.
Our application acts as an intermediary between an NGO and an individual willing to volunteer and contribute, thus easing out connectivity and accessibility.
